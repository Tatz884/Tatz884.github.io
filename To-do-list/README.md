# Full Stack To-do List App
[Live app is here](url)
## Purposes of this project
I made this simple to-do app that works on the web, in order to learn commonly used technologies that span across frontend, backend, database and operation.

## App features
You can type tasks in the form and click "Add item" button.
You can delete tasks by clicking "Done" button.
The data persists after closing and re-opening browswers.

## My takeaways
I learned the following technologies:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, TailWindCSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- Database: MySQL
- Others: Github, Docker, Fly.io

## Future directions

This app is still to be updated.

The following features will be implemented.
1. Better UI
2. Security
3. Data analysis and visualization, so that users can view frequently used words in tasks, task completion time, etc
4. Reduced latency after adding items
