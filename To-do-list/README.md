# Full Stack To-do List App
**[Live app is here](https://tatz884.github.io/To-do-list/todo-list.html)**
## Purposes of this project
I made this simple to-do list that works on the web, in order to learn commonly used technologies that span across frontend and backend.

## App features
You can type tasks in the form and click "Add item" button.
You can delete tasks by clicking "Done" button.
The data persists after closing and re-opening browswers.

## My takeaways
I learned the following technologies:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- Database: MySQL
- Others: Github, Docker, Fly.io, Ubuntu, VSCode

## Future directions

This app is still to be updated, and likely needs an overhaul since I could not use the most of docker-compose very well. For the further details, see [this issue](https://github.com/Tatz884/Tatz884.github.io/issues/4).

The following features will be implemented.
1. Better UI
2. Security
3. Data analysis and visualization, so that users can view frequently used words in tasks, task completion time, etc

## Credit

The backend logic of this app is made referencing [this FastAPI tutorial (in Japanese)](https://zenn.dev/sh0nk/books/537bb028709ab9).
